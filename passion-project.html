        <h3>CHOOSING THE PROJECT</h3>
        <p class="p1" >Well before we had to decide on what our Passion Projects would be, I already knew what my topic was. For me, picking the topic was easy because I am really interested in coding and want to pursue that further in the future, so I wanted to make that the main topic of my project.</p>
        <p class="p1" >Since I took the ICT course in grade 8 and got to use Scratch to make my own game, coding has become a passion of mine, and I have continued to learn more about coding and have been taking computer science as a course since grade 9. Because of this, I went into the project wanting to share my passion for coding with other people and inspire other young girls and spark their interest in coding. And as a personal goal, I wanted to learn more about how to code my own website, and I had hoped to learn HTML and CSS, the coding languages used to make websites. So, when it was time to finalize our topics, I came up with the idea of creating a website that people could use to learn how to code.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>THE STEPS</h3>
        <p class="p1" >Once the topic was picked out and what I was doing for my project was planned, I had to pick an advisor. I chose Ms. LaPage, as she is the computer science teacher, and she would know more about the topic of coding than any other teacher/staff at the school. In the first advisor meeting, we talked through my ideas and plan and really solidified what I wanted my final product to be.</p>
        <p class="p1" >I started taking the first steps and started my project. I spent the majority of my time researching the two code languages I chose to make my website about, Scratch and HTML+CSS. I also spent a while learning how to code with HTML and CSS. This especially took me a long time because I wanted to completely understand it before teaching others to code.</p>
        <p class="p1" >After I got all my research and felt confident enough to teach people the two coding languages, I started finding helpful resources. I found YouTube videos/tutorials, articles, websites, and other resources that could help people in coding with HTML and CSS, and Scratch.</p>
        <p class="p1" >I also made my own resources because I didn’t want my whole website to be made up of resources I found online. I made reference guides and tutorial videos for Scratch and HTML+CSS, which took me a long time and a lot of effort as I had to code out each project before then record myself coding the project while explaining it and then editing it.</p>
        <p class="p1" >Finally, I started coding my website. I used the knowledge of HTML+CSS I learned previously and made the website with all the information and resources I had been collecting for the past couple of months. It was a process going through and coding my very first website, but since I was confident in the skills I learnt, I was able to make a finished website. Although it doesn’t look as nice as the Wix websites my classmates made, I am very proud of how it turned out.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>THE SUCCESS</h3>
        <p class="p1" >My greatest success in the project was definitely the final product and how much effort I put into it. I really wanted my project to have a purpose and for it to help people. I was confident and knew I could accomplish that, but I quickly realized that I needed to spend significant time working on it. I underestimated the amount of work I needed to do, and I started to doubt if I would finish it and was thinking of cutting parts of my project out to finish it in time. Fortunately, I was able to stay organized and better manage my work and time and complete the project without having to cut anything out in time. Because of all that, seeing the final product made me feel accomplished and proud.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS</h3>
        <p class="p1" >Challenge: One of the most important resources on my website is the tutorial videos that I made, but I actually had trouble creating them in the first place. I first had to spend some time coding what the tutorial was on, and after that, I realized I didn’t know the process of recording a tutorial video for coding. I wasn’t sure how I would explain the code or how to show my process of working through and writing the code. Although I knew the information I wanted to mention, I didn’t want to explain it poorly and not in enough detail for a beginner to understand.</p>
        <p class="p1" >Solution: I researched other coding tutorials. I found a few online that were similar to how I wanted my final product for the video tutorial to look and I watched through them and learnt how other people explained and worked through their code. Even after that, it took some trial and error, but eventually, I got the hang of making the tutorial videos.</p>
        <p class="p1" >Challenge: Another challenge I faced was time. As I previously mentioned, I hadn’t realized how much work it would actually take to create my website. I planned on cutting out certain parts of my website and but I realized that I wouldn’t be happy with the final product if I did so. So I was a bit stuck with a lot more work to do with only a little time left to get it done.</p>
        <p class="p1" >Solution: I kept working on my project with any free time I had at school or home. Especially with the due date coming up, it became a bit stressful, but I needed to create a more in detail plan of what I needed to still get done and when exactly I would do it. After I made that plan, I had no problem finishing my project on time.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>SKILLS LEARNED AND LINKS TO THE FUTURE</h3>
        <p class="p1" >The most important skill I learnt was how to code with HTML+CSS and how to use that coding language to create my own website. I have always wanted to learn how to code my own websites, and finally learning has made me realize how important of a skill it is. As someone who wants to have a career involving coding, being able to build and design a website is very helpful. Knowing more coding languages can also help me in computer science class and with creating my labs or doing activities in class because I have been solidifying my knowledge of concepts and basic coding skills. If I ever want to add to and improve this website in the future, those skills will also greatly benefit me, and I will also learn more skills if I continue working on my website after the Passion Project is done.</p>
        <p class="p1" >I also improved my soft skills during the project, specifically my time management, organization, and work ethic. I usually don’t think about soft skills, but I use them every day, so improving them has allowed me to do better in my daily life, for example, with my homework, at my job and at school. It will also be beneficial to continue improving my soft skills to benefit myself in school and my future career as I get older.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>THE ADVICE</h3>
        <p class="p1" >My advice for anyone planning on coding their own website or creating a Passion Project similar to mine is to be prepared and be organized with your time and planning. Although that sounds like a lot of work, it is worth it and needed to complete a project like this. One of my biggest challenges was that my project took twice as long as I thought it would take to make. Although it might get overwhelming and tempting to create a Wix website instead, you will feel more accomplished and so proud of your work when you get to the final product. So, stay motivated and, of course, make sure this is a project you are passionate about and want to pursue.</p>

        <h3>PROFILE OF A GRADUATE</h3>
        <p class="p1" >The Profile of a Graduate is a collection of characteristics that the students at BH try and accomplish. It helps motivate us to achieve and reach our goals for the future.</p>
        <p class="p1" >Independent- A big part of the Passion Project is being able to be independent in managing and meeting deadlines for your project. Besides the help and advice from my advisor, I worked alone. As an already very independent person, this wasn't an issue for me, but I found that I was developing more confidence in my skills as an independent learner. I became more self-motivated and found ways to be resourceful instead of just asking someone for help and much more. Overall, I can say that I was successfully an independent learner.</p>
        <p class="p1" >Lifelong Learner- As I previously mentioned in my project, I was to pursue and continue to work at and learn about coding in my future and possibly even have a carer involving coding. The more I work on and learn about coding, the more I love it, and I look forward to continuing to learn and improve my coding skills and knowledge.</p>
        <p class="p1" >Passionate- From the start, I knew that my Passion Project would be about coding; it's a topic that interests me. So I took that opportunity to improve my coding skills and knowledge. And as I mentioned before, "The more I work at and learn about coding, the more I grow to love it ." One of my goals with this project was to help share my passion for coding with others.</p>
        <p class="p1" >Resilient- Resilience was very important for me to have while creating my Passion Project. I needed to be resilient and bounce back after every big or small setback and challenge I faced. My motivation and work ethic were tested, but thankfully I was able to push through and create a finished website that I am proud of.</p>
        <p class="p1" >Problem Solver- Being a problem solver was a big part of creating my Passion Project. Being able to face my problems, challenges, and issues head-on and figure out ways to fix and improve them was a skill that was needed to create my website. Especially with coding bigger projects on your own, you come across syntax and logic errors all the time, and being able to work through those was something I needed to get used to doing to get my website finished. I believe it's also important to welcome those problems that make you think because sometimes you come out of it was an even better idea or plan.</p>
