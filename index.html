            <p>The Passion Project is a project that is required for all the grade 10 students at Balmoral Hall to complete. This project allows students to explore and further pursue their personal interests with the support of a teacher advisor of their choice. Students are supposed to work on their project throughout the school year and have progress meetings with their advisor, but the project is very independent, and students need to be able to manage their time and deadlines wisely. Studentsâ€™ topics have to be carefully selected as the goal of the project is for students to enjoy working on their project while at the same time preparing themselves for their futures.</p>

            <p>For my Passion Project, I really wanted to focus on my passion for coding. I wanted to share that passion with others, so I decided to create a website that can teach you how to code. Throughout this website you can explore my Passion Project and the steps I took to create my final product, and also learn how to code if you would like!</p>
